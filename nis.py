#sir i do want to know exactly what you want 
#please mention me 
#on the basis of my evaluation these are the things:
 #case1
  #You want to read subdirectries also(in a present working directory)
  #or you only want to read files  and ignoring subdirectries 
 #case2
  #you want to read all the files of a perticular extension and want to
  #modify   all with something
